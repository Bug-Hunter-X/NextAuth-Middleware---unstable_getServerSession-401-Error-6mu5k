# NextAuth Middleware Session Issue

This repository demonstrates a problem with using `unstable_getServerSession` within Next.js middleware.  The implementation sometimes returns a 401 Unauthorized error even when a valid session exists.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Attempt to access a protected route; you'll likely encounter a 401 error intermittently.

## Expected Behavior

The middleware should correctly validate the session and allow access to protected routes when a user is logged in.

## Actual Behavior

The middleware inconsistently returns 401 Unauthorized, even with a valid session.

## Solution

The solution involves careful handling of the NextAuth session within the middleware and proper error handling. Refer to the `middlewareSolution.js` file for a possible fix.  This often involves handling request timing and ensuring proper middleware chain execution.
